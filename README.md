# Login-Validation
The project involves securely managing user sign-up data through local storage. During login, the system verifies whether a user has previously signed up. If confirmed, access is granted, redirecting the user to the dashboard. Conversely, if a user attempts to access the dashboard directly without logging in, redirection to the login page is enforced.

Additionally, while a user is logged in, attempts to navigate to the signup or login pages are restricted to maintain security and prevent unauthorized access. This mechanism ensures a seamless and secure user experience. The implementation emphasizes data integrity and user authentication, promoting a robust user management system. The system fosters a user-centric approach, enhancing the overall security and accessibility of the application.
